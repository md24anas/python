Calculate and print the total sales for the week from the data provided. Print out a string of the form "This week's total sales: xxx", where xxx will be the actual total of all the numbers. 
You’ll need to change the type of the input data in order to calculate that total.

mon_sales = "121"
tues_sales = "105"
wed_sales = "110"
thurs_sales = "98"
fri_sales = "95"

#TODO: Print a string with this format: This week's total sales: xxx
# You will probably need to write some lines of code before the print statement.
nm=int(mon_sales)
nt=int(tues_sales)
nw=int(wed_sales)
nth=int(thurs_sales)
nf=int(fri_sales)
total_sales = (nm+nt+nw+nth+nf)
print(" This week's total sales: "+str(total_sales))
