Now it's your turn to work with variables. The comments in this quiz (the lines that begin with #) have instructions for creating and modifying variables. After each comment write a line of code that implements the instruction.

Note that this code uses scientific notation to define large numbers. 4.445e8 is equal to 4.445 * 10 ** 8 which is equal to 444500000.0.

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
reservoir_volume=444500000
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6
rainfall=5000000

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall=(rainfall-(5000000/10))
# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume+=rainfall
# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
reservoir_volume=reservoir_volume+(reservoir_volume*0.05)
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm

# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume=reservoir_volume-(reservoir_volume*0.05)
# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
reservoir_volume=reservoir_volume-250000
# that's piped to arid regions.

# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)
