Write a function named readable_timedelta. The function should take one argument, an integer days, 
and return a string that says how many weeks and days that is. For example, calling the function and printing the result like this:

print(readable_timedelta(10))
should output the following:

1 week(s) and 3 day(s).
# write your function here
def readable_timedata(days):
    week=(days//7)
    remaining_days=days%7
    return "{} weeks and {} days" .format(week, remaining_days)

# test your function
print(readable_timedata(10))
