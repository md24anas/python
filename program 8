Write an if statement that lets a competitor know which of these prizes they won based on the number of points they scored, 
which is stored in the integer variable points.

Points	Prize
1 - 50	wooden rabbit
51 - 150	no prize
151 - 180	wafer-thin mint
181 - 200	penguin
All of the lower and upper bounds here are inclusive, and points can only take on positive integer values up to 200.

In your if statement, assign the result variable to a string holding the appropriate message based on the value of points. 
If they've won a prize, the message should state "Congratulations! You won a [prize name]!" with the prize name. 
If there's no prize, the message should state "Oh dear, no prize this time."

points = 75  # use this input to make your submission

# write your if statement here
if points<=50:
    print("Congratulations! You won a wodden rabbit!")
elif points>=51 and points<=150:
    print("Oh dear, no prize this time")
elif points>=151 and points<=181:
    print("Congratulations! You won a waffer-thin mint")
elif  points>=181 and points<=200:
    print("Congratulations! You won a penguin")
else:
    print("Imvalid input")
